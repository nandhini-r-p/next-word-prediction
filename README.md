# Next Word Prediction with LSTM

This project implements a next word prediction model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). The model is trained on a corpus of text data and predicts the most likely word to follow a given sequence of words.

## Introduction

Next word prediction is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves predicting the next word in a sequence of words. This project utilizes LSTM, a type of RNN, which is well-suited for sequence prediction tasks due to its ability to capture long-term dependencies in the data.
